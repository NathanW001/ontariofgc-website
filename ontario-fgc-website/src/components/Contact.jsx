          <p>As mentioned above, this site is unofficial and upkept by dedicated community members. If you noticed something missing, or would like to add something, the easiest way to contact me is either through Discord @wonton001 or through Twitter (X) <a href="https://x.com/wontonfgc">@WontonFGC</a>. Thanks again for your feedback, I hope this site has been useful to navigate the fighting game community within Ontario!</p>
          <p>Special thanks to Zykles, dollarnuftynuf, Schmeez, gemi+, dmcAxle, pott8o, and everyone else who worked with me to provide resources and information. This site wouldn't be half as good without your help!</p>
          <p>Finally, extra special thanks to Casper for working with me to make this site possible. Without their help, this resource wouldn't be here.</p>
